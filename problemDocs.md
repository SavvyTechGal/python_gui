    Description: Layout of components were conflicting with aspects each contributor had created. 
    Solution: Created a Grid Layout system for our gui, so that each component can be added to a specifc row/col of the main window. Each component can have its own defined layout, as long as it is inserted in the main window grid at the appropriate location.
